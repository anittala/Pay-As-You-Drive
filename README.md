# Pay-As-You-Drive
application provides a service for vehicle insurance customers where they will receive the insurance amount based on their driving skills. These skills will be judged primarily on the basis of their acceleration, speed and gyroscope readings taken from their mobile devices which give the values for sudden turns and braking. These values will in turn give the percentage of the aggressive driving performed by the driver. They will be judged on these parameters for the length of 12 months after which they will be given a new insurance amount for the next year.
